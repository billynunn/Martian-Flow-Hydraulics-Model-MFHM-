# Important Information 
The Martian Flow Hydraulics Model, hereafter referred to as MFHM, is a basic deterministic model created to reconstruct the flow hydraulics of Martian rivers; whereby, Earth-based open-channel hydraulic parameters are automatically adjusted to reflect Mars' planetary conditions. MFHM was originally designed as part of an undergraduate Geography & Environmental Science coursework piece, with the primary objective of aimed to reconstruct Reull Vallis—an inactive ~1,700km ancient fluvial system. 

Disclaimer: this code is not intended to present a definitive or fully validated reconstruction of Martian hydrology; but rather, a transparent framework through which planetary scaling effects may be explained. 

# Key Features
As the result of the projects time-constraints, MFHM implements a limited but integral set of hydraulic functions required to reconstruct Martain rivers. The current implementation encompasses several key measurements, including: velocity, discharge, stream power, and Froude number.

# Requirements 
`JupyterLab`
`Python 3.10+`
